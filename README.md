## ⚡ Hardware Telemetry & Benchmarking Highlights

This system executes zero-shot and fine-tuned wafer defect classification locally using dedicated AMD hardware and the ROCm software stack:

| Metric | Local AMD Hardware Radeon (PyTorch ROCm) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Training Time** | **36.52 seconds** |
| **Step Throughput** | **0.90 – 1.04 iterations/sec** |
| **Sample Processing Speed** | **7.229 samples/sec** |
| **Inference Engine** | **Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct** (LoRA Adapted via SDPA) |
| **Operational Cost** | **$0.00** (Fixed, Air-gapped Bare-Metal) |

### Key Architectural Takeaways for Judges:
1. **On-Premise Security:** Guarantees absolute data privacy by processing sensitive semiconductor fab test data locally without relying on external cloud APIs.
2. **High-Throughput Localized Execution:** Optimizes AMD Radeon hardware via ROCm and bfloat16 precision to deliver rapid zero-shot defect classification and deterministic JSON audit outputs.

## 🛠️ Repository, System Structure & Script Order

* *Execute this core logic repository first to generate the necessary CSV and JSON audit logs, then run the UI repository to render the dashboard.*
* **UI Repository Link:** [Wafer Map UI](https://huggingface.co/spaces/uttarasawant/amd_radeon_wafer_map_classification)
* `download_data.py` - Script to download the raw semiconductor wafer map dataset from Roboflow Universe.
* `prepare_dataset_amd.py` - Converts dataset annotations into a structured VLM training format and organizes outputs into the `data/processed` folder.
* `train_amd_native.py` - Fine-tunes the base model using processed training outputs on AMD hardware and saves checkpoints to `./models/wafer_map_qwen_lora`.
* `inference_amd.py` - Runs a single-image inference test using the fine-tuned LoRA weights on AMD hardware.
* `batch_audit_amd.py` - Executes full test set evaluation, parsing results into `wafer_batch_inference_summary.json` and `wafer_defect_summary_log.csv`.
* `wafer_defect_summary_log.csv` - The parsed operational risk matrices displayed on the audit dashboard UI.
* `wafer_batch_inference_summary.json` - The inference results for the image batch.
